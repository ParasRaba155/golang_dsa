## In this project we would try to implement the `Stack` Data Type in Golang

### From Quick Google search we find that Stack is the data structure with the following operations

### A Stack follows F.I.L.O. (First In Last Out) model

- Push : Add an element to the top of Stack
- Pop : Remove an element from the top of Stack
- IsEmpty : Check if the Stack is empty 
- IsFull : Check if the stack is full 
- Peek : Get the value of the top element without removing it
